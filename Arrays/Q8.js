//String rotation - Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given 2 string s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring. Eg. "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat"


//The only solution that I am able to find online is to concatenate string1 and strin2, and then find if string1 exists in the concatenated string
